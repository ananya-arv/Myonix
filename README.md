A wearable rehabilitation sleeve designed to gamify forearm exercises by combining muscle activity sensing (EMG) with cognitive load monitoring (EDA and heart rate). The system adapts exercise difficulty in real-time using lightweight machine learning, providing an AI-driven coach that distinguishes between physical fatigue and mental effort.
